# AI_News_Bias_Detection
 Machine learning project to detect fake news using logistic regression.

## Project Completed âœ… 
- Preprocessed the text data by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, and removing stopwords. 
- Employed TF-IDF vectorization to transform the textual data into numerical features. Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model achieved a high accuracy of 0.968.
- Through this project, gained hands-on experience in implementing logistic regression and explored its application in the context of news classification. 
- This project involved conducting meaningful research and investigation into the impact of AI on the news industry and demonstrated the potential of machine learning algorithms in combating the spread of misinformation.
